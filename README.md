# matthras.com fullstack app

Bootstrapped with KeystoneJS 4.0.0 beta 7.

## History

My early blogging days started on MSN Spaces, moved to Livejournal, then Wordpress.com, then hosting my own website using the Wordpress CMS, and now to this: a full-stack app hosted on a DigitalOcean VPS.

Future plans for this include transitioning away from Keystone as I continue to learn more about NodeJS, Express as well as everything else needed for my own personal CMS/full-stack app.

## Requirements

* Node
* MongoDB (Note that Keystone will initiate a new database)
